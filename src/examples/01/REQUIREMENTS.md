# Overview

The first round of security reviews was conducted by an external security firm. The results were pretty bad for such a simple contract, and the CTO is livid. You show up to the meeting and get yelled at for writing such bad code. The CTO is demanding you fix the code immediately. They refused to give you the findings, so you're on your own.

Good luck.
